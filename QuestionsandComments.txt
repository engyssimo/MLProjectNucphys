This document is to put some important information, questions, comments or things to do

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS


- What conclusion can we extract from the comparison of cross validation and bootstrap graph?


- Discussion of the scaling, importance, effects, etc


- We need to understand the results coming from cross validation, a bit strange 

NOTES


- The bootstrap sampling gives us the same optimal complexity as the MSE (training and test ), and this is good, but the cross validation gives us an optimal complexity of 3, why? 

THINGS TO CHANGE ON CODE

- Need to use same set of data for everything, to be able to compare, sometimes we create new data for a section
