COMMENTS

- Important, and often stated to create own code: we have copied some stuff from his code, like creation of design matrix, is that ok?
- In his book he says: "You should a critical discussion of why and how you have scaled or not scaled the data
- In what way does the scaling of the data influence what we have done?






Extra stuff done by Marvin

- Some of this stuff I am keeping in private files, if you want to I can upload them


1. Dependence of the MSE as a function of the increase in noise
2. Estimated the variance of the betas ( parameters from the OLS ) 
- Confidence interval not so clear, some of the uncertainties in the parameters are high 
- Important to check that it is correct, maybe numerically,
3. Also have done the plot of the MSE as a function of model complexity (up to 12 degrees of freedom)
- This is quite a bit erratic, definetely check a different way
